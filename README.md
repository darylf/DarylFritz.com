# DarylFritz.com

My homepage is designed as a single page with clean and minimal HTML5 markup.
The page is a short description of who I am, with links to the social networks
I use regularly. The content is marked up with semantic HTML5 microdata so it
could be parsed and used as my online identification card. The page is hosted
on _Github_ using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com).
